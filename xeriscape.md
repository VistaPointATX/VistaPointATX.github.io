Xeriscaping is the process of landscaping, or gardening, that reduces or eliminates the need for irrigation. It is promoted in regions that do not have accessible, plentiful, or reliable supplies of fresh water and is gaining acceptance in other regions as access to irrigation water is becoming limited; though it is not limited to such climates. Xeriscaping may be an alternative to various types of traditional gardening. Xeriscaping produces greenspaces that require low amounts of maintenance and irrigation, and promote biodiversity.
